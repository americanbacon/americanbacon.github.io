<h1>Recursive Art</h1>
<p>Project Creator:  Tricia Bacon</p>
<p>Description of Project:  This application allows viewers to both see an example of recursive art created using Java and interact with it by moving a slider that changes the size of each piece of the wave.</p>
<p>Concepts Used:  I used recursive method calls to create the design for the project - a series of waves within a much larger wave. I also used Java's built in shapes class to create this image.  The other major concept I used was mapping fields in Eclipse to SceneBuilder in order to create the canvas and get the width slider to move. </p>
<p>Challenges Overcome:  The hardest part of this project was moving the design I created in Eclipse to the canvas in SceneBuilder.  I spent a lot of time trying to reorganize my code so that the image would show up rather than just being a blank canvas.</p>
<p>Individual Contributions:  I was the only person working on this project, so most of the contributions here are my own.  The only collaboration I had was with the amazing COMP 110 TA's and Kris, who helped me with coming up with the project idea and transferring everything to SceneBuilder.</p>
<p>Goals Achieved:  My basic goal for the project was to create cool-looking recursive art and add a slider in some way to make it interactable.  I was definitely able to achieve that!</p>
<p>Goals Outstanding:  In the future, I might try to add another way to make the art more interactable - perhaps another slider that affects the degree to which the art is rotated or by how much each progressive image is shrunk.</p>
